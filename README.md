# robotframework-dwdweather
[Robot Framework](https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework) library for public weather service in Germany. Wraps original python implementation from [dwdweather2](https://github.com/hiveeyes/dwdweather2).

# Incompatible with Python3
dwdweather2 is not compatible with python3, yet. Therefore this robotframework-library requires python2, too.
